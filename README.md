# Chad's Prework Study Guide

## Description

The purpose or motivation behind creating this web application was for exposure to brief new concepts and principles for working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while simultaneously maintaining an up-to-date flow between my local git repository and the one on Github. While relatively fresh, these concepts are in no way cemented in my mind but in practice I was able to follow along and complete all the task and will continue to update the notes section as the start of bootcamp gets closer.

## Usage

This web application is intended to be used to go over basic principles of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript so a working knowledge of them can be applied when an official introduction to these languages and repos commences in December â€™24. Each section contains and will contain concepts utilized to create and deploy this web application in VS code and Github. Pressing ctrl+shift+i will bring up developer tools in browser that will let you view the working JavaScript on this web page.
